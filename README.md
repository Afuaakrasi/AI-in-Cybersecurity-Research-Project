# The Role of AI in Cybersecurity  
*Academic Research Project — Elmhurst University (2025)*

This repository contains the complete research project created by my group at Elmhurst University on **The Role of AI in Cbersecurity**. The paper examines how machine learning, deep learning, behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and autonomous systems improve threat detection and incident response across modern networks.
